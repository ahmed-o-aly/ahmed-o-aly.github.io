I am an operations research and data science practitioner focused on energy systems, optimization, and applied algorithms. I currently work as a Research Assistant at Khalifa University, partnering with the Dubai Electricity & Water Authority (DEWA) to optimize renewables, storage, and demand across large-scale power systems. My recent work blends Python optimization (Gurobi, Pyomo), simulation (pvlib, oemof, EnergyPlus), and modular software design with testing and documentation.

Previously, I led optimization products at AHOY DMCC, building metaheuristics for routing, clustering, and facility location under real-world traffic and capacity constraints. I also developed stochastic variable neighborhood search approaches for delivery territory design, presenting at VNS 2022 and advancing the work through peer-reviewed publications.

I earned a BSc in Applied Mathematics and Statistics from Khalifa University and am pursuing a part-time MSc in Data Science (Statistics) at the University of Leeds. Beyond research, I enjoy turning complex systems into intuitive interfaces, mentoring teammates on optimization tooling, and collaborating on open, well-tested codebases.
