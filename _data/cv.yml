    - title: Research Assistant
      institution: Khalifa University
      year: 2025.01 - Present
      location: Abu Dhabi, UAE
      description:
        - Partnered with Dubai Electricity & Water Authority (DEWA) on optimizing renewables, storage, and demand.
        - Built large-scale Python optimization models (Gurobi) with minute-level discretization over a full-year horizon.
        - Modeled power asset operations incorporating ramp rates, spinning reserves, and non-linear efficiency curves.
        - Built a modular optimization library with Pytest, Sphinx documentation, and an interactive Streamlit/Plotly UI.
        - Developed renewables and chiller simulations (pvlib, oemof, EnergyPlus) to generate realistic time-series data.
        - Formulated levelized cost metrics, validated by DEWA experts, to trace energy costs from supply to demand.

      institution: AHOY DMCC
      year: 2022.05 - 2023.03
      location: Dubai, UAE
      description:
        - Led a cross-functional team as product manager for a flagship routing product.
        - Built metaheuristics in Python (GRASP, Tabu Search, VNS) for VRPs, clustering, and facility location problems under time, capacity, and safety constraints.
        - Integrated real-time traffic and weather data via asynchronous pipelines to improve routing decisions and government policy adherence.
        - Designed REST APIs (FastAPI, Node.js) to expose algorithms as services for internal clients.
        - Containerized and automated builds with Docker and Azure DevOps; created ETL from REST APIs to Azure Blob Storage.
        - Used profiling tools (cProfile) to identify and optimize code bottlenecks, enhancing performance by over 20%.
